### Acoustic Siren Detection Using MFCC features and Neural Network
    Instructions:
    1. Create folders 'training_data' and 'test_data' in the working directory
         - Put samples in 'siren' and 'no_siren' folders for training and test.
    2. Run script neural_net_learn.m to traing the neural_net and generate C\C++ code for ARM-Cortex M
    3. Run script main.m to test
