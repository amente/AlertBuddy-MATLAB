### Acoustic Siren Detection Using MFCC features and Neural Network

    Requirements:
         - MATLAB R2015a
         - Neural Network Toolbox 
         - MATLAB Coder Toolbox
         - MATLAB Coder Support Package for ARM Cortex-M
    
    Instructions:
    1. Create folders 'training_data' and 'test_data' in the working directory
         - Put samples in 'siren' and 'no_siren' folders for training and test.
    2. Run script neural_net_learn.m to train the neural_net and generate C\C++ code for ARM-Cortex M
    3. Run script main.m to test
